# weather-dashboard

## About Task
For this week's assignment, I needed to complete a weather dashboard that allows a user to search any city's current weather. This dashboard include features that will dynamically update the HTML and CSS. This weather dashboard will also include a 5 day forecast feature and a search history bar. This assigment will use Moment.js library to work with date and time and use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## User Story
* AS A traveler
* I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
* SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria 
* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
